# Speech Competition System Based on STL

![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-11%2F14%2F17-blue)

## Overview

The Speech Competition System is a C++ program that manages and tracks the scores of speakers in a competition. It utilizes the Standard Template Library (STL) to efficiently manage data structures and simplify the scoring process.

This project demonstrates my skills in C++ programming, data structures, and software design principles. It also highlights my proficiency in using STL containers and algorithms for practical applications.

## Features

- Efficiently manages speaker data, scores, and competition records.
- Utilizes STL containers, such as `std::map` and `std::vector`, to organize and store data.
- Implements software design principles for a well-structured and maintainable codebase.
- Offers a user-friendly menu-driven interface for easy interaction.

## Skills Demonstrated

- C++ Programming: Proficient in C++ with knowledge of C++11/14/17 features.
- STL Usage: Effective utilization of Standard Template Library (STL) containers and algorithms.
- Software Design: Implementation of software design principles for maintainable code.
- Menu-Driven Interface: Development of a user-friendly interface for interaction.
